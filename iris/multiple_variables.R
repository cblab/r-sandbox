# covariance and correlation between sepal length and petal length
#Covariance is a measure of how changes in one variable are associated with changes in a second variable.
#Specifically, covariance measures the degree to which two variables are linearly associated.
#However, it is also often used informally as a general measure of how monotonically related two variables are.
